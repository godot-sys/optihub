## Overview

The **OptiHub** repository is a growing knowledge base focused on the latest trends, advancements, and research at the intersection of AI and discrete optimization, and related fields such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning in optimization, and operations research.

This is not just a repository for random thoughts â€” our goal is to provide insightful, in-depth analyses, tutorials, discussions, and curated research papers that can serve as a reference for both the internal team and the broader developer community interested in optimization problems. 

### Key Areas of Focus:

- **Algorithmic Design**: New algorithms, heuristic methods, and solvers in discrete optimization.
- **Technology Innovations**: Relevant tech stacks, tools, and frameworks.
- **Applied Research**: The latest research papers and their practical applications.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world problems and case studies.
- **Open-source Contributions**: Libraries and tools that are shaping the future of optimization.

## Purpose

This repository serves three primary purposes:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: To consolidate ideas, research, and findings in discrete optimization and adjacent fields, including applications to logistics, supply chain, resource allocation, and more.
  
2. **Collaboration**: A space where team members and contributors can discuss emerging technologies, methodologies, and algorithms, and how these can be applied or adapted for solving large-scale optimization problems.
   
3. **Innovation**: An open forum to inspire and accelerate innovation by capturing the collective wisdom and research in the field of optimization.

## Structure

The **OptiHub** repository is organized into the following main directories:

### 1. `blog_posts/`

This directory contains technical blog posts written by team members or contributors. Each blog post focuses on a specific aspect of discrete optimization, technology applications, or emerging research. Blog posts can include tutorials, deep dives into specific algorithms, or overviews of important industry trends.

### 2. `technology_discussions/`

Here, you'll find curated discussions around emerging tools, languages, and frameworks relevant to solving optimization problems. The objective of these discussions is to offer insights on how to incorporate various technologies into real-world projects.

### 3. `research_papers/`

This directory contains important academic papers, reports, and articles that are either directly referenced in our blog posts or are considered essential reading for anyone working in the optimization space.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from team members and external collaborators. Contributions can be in the form of blog posts, adding relevant papers to the collection, or starting a new technology discussion. 

### Contribution Guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you're an external contributor, begin by forking this repository and making your changes locally.

2. **Create a New Branch**: For new posts or papers, create a new branch with a descriptive name, such as `add-optimization-paper-x` or `blog-heuristic-methods`.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're ready, submit a pull request with your changes. Please ensure you follow the existing directory structure and format your post using Markdown.

4. **Discussion and Feedback**: Use the Issues section to open up new discussions or to ask for feedback before submitting a formal blog post or paper review.

## Best Practices

We aim to uphold a high standard of quality in both the content and discussions posted in **OptiHub** by focusing on:

- **Clarity**: Write in a way that makes complex topics accessible to a broad audience, while maintaining depth for advanced readers.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure that any algorithms, technologies, or papers referenced are correctly cited and described.
- **Relevance**: Contributions should be directly relevant to discrete optimization or adjacent fields.

We like a high SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) at `Godot Systems`.
